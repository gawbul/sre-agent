contain reference to a file.

Once you have these errors and the file name, get the file contents of the path
{_get_prompt_server_config().project_root} for the repository
{_get_prompt_server_config().repo_name} in the organisation
{_get_prompt_server_config().organisation}. Keep listing the directories until you
find the file name and then get the contents of the file.

Please use the file contents to diagnose the error, then please create an issue in
GitHub reporting a fix for the issue. Once you have diagnosed the error and created an
issue please report this to the following Slack channel: {slack_channel_id}.

Please only do this ONCE, don't keep making issues or sending messages to Slack."""
